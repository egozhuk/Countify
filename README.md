New logo

New Settings view. It can be openned through clicking on Countify->Settings in menubar.
There will be a list of supported operations. And a few new settings:
1) Text size
2) Color theme (dark / light)
3) Maybe more new settings

New parsing system(my own). It works a little faster and it will have changes in syntax. But it is much easier for adding new operations.
